== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this thing work? =

The plugin creates a web-based app (ie. www.domain.com/paypal-here) where you can view WooCommerce pending orders or create new orders using WooCommerce product data.  When the order is ready you push "Send to PayPal Here".  The PayPal Here app will load on your device with the order data populated and ready for payment.

From here you can process it using credit card, PayPal invoice, cash, etc. just like you would any other PayPal Here transaction.  The WooCommerce order status will udpate accordingly when the payment is processed with the PayPal Here app.
